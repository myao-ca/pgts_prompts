Using the provided raw interview transcript and the corresponding JSON metadata from a YouTube video, create a detailed report that accurately reflects the interviewee's discourse and the contextual video information. The report should be constructed in two formats: a user-friendly text summary and a structured CSV file suitable for aggregation with other interview data. Follow these detailed instructions:

User-Friendly Text Summary:

Video Metadata Summary: Present the video metadata at the start of the report with clear headings for each piece of information:
Title: The title of the video as it appears in the metadata.
Video URL: The full YouTube video URL constructed from the video ID provided in the metadata.
Posted Time: The time and date the video was posted, formatted for readability (e.g., 'September 5, 2023').
YouTuber: The name or identifier of the channel that uploaded the video.
Transcript: Include the entire interview transcript, formatted under a clear heading.
Comprehensive Transcript Analysis: Conduct a detailed analysis of the interview transcript, broken down into clearly defined sections:
Summary: Articulate the central ideas or themes the interviewee communicates.
In-Depth Main Points: Enumerate and elaborate on the main points for each subject discussed by the interviewee.
Arguments and Reasoning: Detail the arguments and evidence the interviewee provides.
Comparative Analysis: Contrast the interviewee's views with other perspectives presented during the interview.
Rhetorical Techniques: Describe the rhetorical strategies the interviewee employs.
Confidence and Tone: Assess the interviewee's confidence and tone.
Consistency Across Topics: Evaluate the consistency of the interviewee's statements across the interview.
Questioning and Doubt: Highlight moments of self-questioning or doubt.
Adaptability and Future Views: Gauge the interviewee's openness to changing their views.
Calls to Action and Motivation: Identify any calls to action and the motivations behind them.
Challenges and Objectives: Note the challenges the interviewee discusses and their objectives.
Underlying Motivations: Infer the motivations behind the interviewee's perspectives.
CSV File Formation:

Format the collected and analyzed information into a CSV file with the following columns: 'Title', 'Video URL', 'Posted Time', 'YouTuber', 'Transcript', 'Summary', 'In-Depth Main Points', 'Arguments and Reasoning', 'Comparative Analysis', 'Rhetorical Techniques', 'Confidence and Tone', 'Consistency Across Topics', 'Questioning and Doubt', 'Adaptability and Future Views', 'Calls to Action and Motivation', 'Challenges and Objectives', 'Underlying Motivations'.
For each column, input the relevant content directly from the user-friendly summary. Ensure all content under each heading in the summary is transferred verbatim into the corresponding column of the CSV.
Each row in the CSV file should represent a unique interview. If multiple interviews are analyzed, repeat the structure for each interview, adding a new row to the CSV file.
Final Report Instructions:

Ensure that the text summary is readable, engaging, and formatted with appropriate headings and subheadings.
Confirm that the CSV file is well-organized with headers, with each piece of content correctly placed under its corresponding column, ready to be compiled with additional interviews.
The outputs should be two distinct but correlated documents that provide a full account of the interviewee's contributions to the interview and include all necessary video metadata, prepared in formats that support both readability and data analysis.
